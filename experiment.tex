\section{Experimental Setup}
The results from our experiments should only be fully accepted with respect to
the microprocessors we specify in this section, although the conclusions will
generally apply to different generations of the hardware. 

The Intel experimental machine contains a Haswell i7-4770 processor with 4
3.40GHz cores, 4 total hardware threads, 64 byte wide cache lines, an 8MB
shared 16-way \textit{L3} cache, and 32KB per-core 8-way \textit{L1} caches.

The IBM experimental machine contains a Power8 processor with 10 3.425GHz cores,
80 total hardware threads, 128 byte wide cache lines, an 80MB shared 8-way
\textit{L3} cache (roughly 8mB per-core), and 64KB per-core 8-way \textit{L1}
caches.

All experiments are written in C and compiled with GCC, optimization level
\textit{-O0}. Our experiments use the GCC hardware transactional memory
intrinsics interface.
